These problems will be grouped by category, sorted by the order that 
they appear in https://cses.fi/problemset/

Usually, I try to analyze the time complexity. I only analyze space complexity 
if it is relevant due to tight memory limits (since SC <= TC).

The difficulty estimate is based on the DMOJ point system and my own 
experience (which is obviously biased).

- in this system, the point is based off the difficulty of the concept required, in 
addition to the problem itself 
  - so a template segment tree problem would have a 
  higher point value than a difficult binary search problem since 
  the concept itself is harder
  - "Ad hoc" refers to uncategorized observation/thinking based problems 
   (more thinking than coding) and tend to require mathematical intuition.
    - "Constructive", usually has ad hoc aspects and requires you to make a 
      structure (array,tree,etc.) satisfying some property
  - "Implementation" either means the problem is implementation heavy or there is
    not really an algorithm and you just have to code it.
